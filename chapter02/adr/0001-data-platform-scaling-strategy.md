# Architecture Decision Record: 0001 - Data Platform Scaling Strategy

## 1. Context
Our central Data Lakehouse for the marketing team has successfully enabled data-driven insights. However, as new business units (e.g., Product and Logistics) are eager to leverage data and build their own data products, the central data team is becoming a significant bottleneck. This centralized model is hindering overall organizational agility and speed of innovation for these new initiatives.

## 2. Decision
We will adopt a **Phased Data Mesh** approach to scale our data platform. We will begin by treating the Product and Logistics teams as pilot domains for this decentralized model. This approach involves:
- Decentralizing data ownership and responsibility to relevant business domains.
- Treating data as a product within each domain.
- Establishing a federated computational governance model to ensure interoperability and overall consistency.
- Leveraging our existing central Data Lakehouse as a foundational data platform for the mesh.

## 3. Alternatives Considered

### 3.1. The Independent Lakehouses
- **Description**: Allow each new domain (Product, Logistics) to build and manage its own entirely separate data Lakehouse with minimal central oversight.
- **Rationale for Rejection**: While this offers maximum autonomy, it carries a high risk of creating new data silos, inconsistent data definitions, fragmented governance, and duplication of infrastructure costs. It would undermine our long-term goal of a unified, trustworthy data ecosystem.

### 3.2. The Hub-and-Spoke Model
- **Description**: Maintain the central Data Lakehouse as the primary hub for core data, and allow domain-specific data marts or smaller lakes ("spokes") to be built and managed by individual teams, with data flowing from the central hub.
- **Rationale for Rejection**: While offering some decentralization, this model often retains a strong central bottleneck for core data transformations and governance enforcement, contradicting our primary "Speed and Autonomy" priority for domain-driven innovation. It doesn't fully empower domains to manage their data end-to-end as a product.

## 4. Rationale
The **Phased Data Mesh** approach aligns most directly with our primary goal to **"accelerate domain-driven innovation."**
- **Empowers Domains (Agility)**: By shifting ownership and enabling domain teams to treat data as a product, it directly addresses the organizational bottleneck (Second Wall).
- **Federated Governance (Trusted Governance)**: It establishes governance rules (Layer 3: Legislation) at a global level (e.g., data contracts, interoperability standards) while allowing local autonomy, ensuring data quality and trust without centralized friction.
- **Leverages Existing Investment (Efficiency)**: It builds upon our successful central Data Lakehouse (Layer 1/2 foundation) rather than abandoning it, promoting efficient resource utilization.
- **Scalability**: Designed for large, complex organizations, it offers a scalable framework for managing diverse data needs across numerous domains.
This approach balances the need for agility and decentralization with the critical requirement for consistent governance and overall data integrity.

## 5. Consequences

### Positive
- Increased speed of innovation within product and logistics domains.
- Improved data ownership and accountability at the source.
- Reduced workload and bottleneck for the central data team.
- Higher data quality and relevance as domains are closer to their data.

### Negative
- Requires a significant cultural shift across the organization (from centralized to decentralized mindset).
- Requires initial investment in platform tooling and training for domain teams to build data products.
- Potential for new silos or inconsistencies if federated governance principles are not properly implemented and enforced.
- Complex initial setup and ongoing platform maintenance for the central platform team.
