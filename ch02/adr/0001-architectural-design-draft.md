# ADR-CH02-001: Architectural Design for the Retail Orders Data Pipeline (Draft)

## Context

**The Problem:** The "Retail-X" company needs to build a new data pipeline to process `retail_orders` data. However, there are multiple competing architectural patterns (e.g., Lakehouse, Data Mesh), and the team lacks a clear, rational basis for choosing the best approach for their specific needs. Simply picking a popular technology without clear justification leads to technical debt and stakeholder misalignment.

**The Goal:** To use a structured, governable process to design a data pipeline architecture. The design must be explicitly linked to business requirements and technical constraints, ensuring the decision is defensible, auditable, and serves as a clear blueprint for implementation. This lab simulates the role of an AI Collaboration Architect (ACA) in leading this design process.

## Decision (To Be Completed in this Lab)

*(Based on the AI's proposals, you will complete this section.)*

## Rationale (To Be Completed in this Lab)

*(You will explain why your chosen architecture is the best fit for the problem described in the Context.)*

---
## Logical Schema Definition (To Be Completed in this Lab)

*As the final step of this hands-on lab, you will work with your AI partner to define the logical schema for the `retail_orders` table based on the chosen architecture.*
