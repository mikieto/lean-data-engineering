# Validation Checklist for Chapter 2 Hands-on

This checklist guides you through the process of completing the ADR for this chapter. Its purpose is to help you verify that you have successfully completed each step of the design process.

## Instructions
Follow the steps in the `README.md`. For each step you complete in your `0001-architectural-design-draft.md`, check off the corresponding item below.

---

### Step 1: Define Intent Verification

-   [ ] **Action**: Review the "Context" section of your `0001-architectural-design-draft.md`.
-   [ ] **Expected Outcome**: You understand the problem and the goals for the architectural design.

### Step 2: Generate and Select Options

-   [ ] **Action**: Use the prompt in the `README.md` to have an AI generate architectural options.
-   [ ] **Expected Outcome**: You have received at least two distinct architectural proposals from the AI.
-   [ ] **Action**: Based on the AI's proposals, complete the "Decision" and "Rationale" sections in your `0001-architectural-design-draft.md`.
-   [ ] **Expected Outcome**: Your `draft.md` now clearly states which architecture you have chosen and *why*.

### Step 3: Define Logical Schema

-   [ ] **Action**: Work with your AI partner to complete the "Logical Schema Definition" section in your `0001-architectural-design-draft.md`.
-   [ ] **Expected Outcome**: Your `draft.md` now contains a complete logical schema for the `retail_orders` table, including data types and quality constraints.

### Final Step: Review and Compare

-   [ ] **Action**: Compare your completed `0001-architectural-design-draft.md` with the provided `0001-architectural-design-solution.md`.
-   [ ] **Expected Outcome**: You have identified the similarities and differences, and understand the reasoning behind the decisions made in the solution file. **This completes the lab.**
